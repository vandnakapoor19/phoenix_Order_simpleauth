# What was the hardest part of the implementation?

#### The transition to Elixir platform is swift. As expected, starting 2-3 days were challenging but on 5th day Iâ€™m more comfortable and confident on it.
#### Below are few of challenges:

-A Setting development environment on Windows machine.
-B Routing & Session management using plugs.
-C Date and time implementation using Timex.
-D Understand the difference between OOP and Funtional programing.

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
