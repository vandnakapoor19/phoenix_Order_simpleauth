# What was the hardest part of the implementation?

#### The transition to the Elixir platform is swift. As expected, the initial 2-3 days were challenging, but on the 5th day, Iâ€™m more comfortable and confident in it.
#### Below are a few challenges:

- Setting development environment on Windows machine.
- Routing & Session management using plugs.
- Date and time implementation using Timex.
- Understand the difference between OOP and Functional programming.


# What would be your next couple of tasks if you had more time?

- Primarily I would like to improve UX.
- The internal user uses case implantation.
- Addition of data Validation on UI, order filter, pagination, email notification.
- Validate Address using USPS REST service call.
- Fuzzy logic to match courier with pharma service provider based on location.
- Integration of Google map & delivery tracking for all roles.
- Code Coverage, which is important aspect of any project for CICD.


# How could we change the project to be more interesting?
#### I can visualize this use case as a typical business process management and case management platform which should seamlessly integrate communication between script-drop, drug, pharma, and end customer.
#### The platform should also support Omnichannel to provide a frictionless experience to end customers.
